                 Stefan here.  
                 Allow me to introduce myself: a bay area native with a deep passion for surfing, skiing, and [you guessed it], coding. It's no secret that us Cal Poly alum take pride in our outdoor endeavours as much as our technology. Feel free to take a look at my work below, and don't hesitate to reach out for inquiries!
